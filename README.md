## Hi, I'm Fernando

Iâ€™m a Software Engineer and I have 6+ years in tech working with back-end, front-end and mobile. I currently work as a full stack developer at Promip and I am responsible for some projects in production.

- I care about good user experience, good software architecture and design
- I created [GrowApp](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=br.com.bison.abacate "GrowApp's Play Store page"), a mobile app for farmers to monitor pests in fields and greenhouses, to help them improve their productivity
- Check [my website](https://fzabin.github.io/ "Fernando Zabin's website") to see more about projects (I'm working on it!)

### My current stack

- **Back-end**: JavaScript, TypeScript, Node.js, REST, GraphQL
- **Mobile**: React Native (I worked a while with Android and Kotlin)
- **Front-end**: React, Next.js, React Query, GraphQL
- **Databases**: PostgreSQL, SQLite, MongoDB, MySQL
- **Other**: Domain Driven Design, Clean Code, Scrum, Kanban, Docker, Git
