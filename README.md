## Hi, I'm Fernando

Iâ€™m a Software Engineer. I currently work as a full stack developer at Promip and I am responsible for some projects in production.

- I created [GrowApp](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=br.com.bison.abacate "GrowApp's Play Store page"), a mobile app for farmers to monitor pests in fields and greenhouses, to help them improve their productivity
- I have 6 years of experience in tech working with back-end, front-end and mobile
- I care about good user experience, good software architecture and design
- Check [my website](https://fzabin.github.io/ "Fernando Zabin's website") to see more about projects (I'm working on it!)
